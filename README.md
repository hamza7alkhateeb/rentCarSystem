## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Development Guidelines

* Each developer should **create a new branch** before starting work:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
  git push -u origin your-branch-name
  ```
* Use your **own virtual environment** and **local database**.
* Always install the latest dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

use :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üåü Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

To elevate the system toward a fully integrated car rental management platform, our future plans include the development of intelligent and advanced operational features:

### A. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI)

These features will optimize revenue and minimize operational risk by leveraging data-driven decisions:

* **Dynamic Pricing:** Use machine learning algorithms to automatically adjust rental prices based on **real-time demand**, **seasonality**, and fleet availability to maximize yield.
* **Predictive Maintenance:** Analyze vehicle usage data, mileage, and historical failure patterns to **forecast potential breakdowns** and schedule maintenance proactively.
* **Automated Damage Detection:** Apply **Computer Vision** techniques to inspect vehicle conditions through uploaded images/videos at check-in/out, ensuring transparency and minimizing customer disputes.
* **Fraud Prevention & Identity Verification:** Implement AI models to enhance accuracy in **verifying customer documents** (e.g., driving licenses) and detecting suspicious booking behaviors to mitigate financial risk.

---

### B. Fleet Management & Operations

These enhancements focus on securing and optimizing the physical assets and administrative workflow:

* **GPS Tracking:** Integrate **real-time GPS tracking** for vehicles to monitor fleet movement, security, and optimize logistics.
* **Comprehensive Maintenance Management:** Implement modules to manage detailed **maintenance schedules**, renewal dates, and digital vehicle licensing records.
* **Customer Eligibility Management:** Digitally verify driving licenses and required legal documents to **ensure renter eligibility** and compliance before confirming a booking.

---

### C. User Experience & Technology

These items ensure a modern, secure, and user-friendly platform:

* **Improved Security & Authentication:** Strengthen user session management by adopting **JWT Authentication** and enhanced security protocols.
* **Integrated Online Payments:** Add reliable electronic payment options (e.g., Stripe/PayPal integration) to **simplify the booking and payment process**.
* **Front-End Development:** Build a clean and responsive user interface (using **React/Vue** for the customer side and **Bootstrap** for the Admin dashboard).
* **Advanced Dashboards & Reports:** Provide management dashboards with **deep analytics** and insights on rentals, revenue, fleet utilization, and performance metrics.
